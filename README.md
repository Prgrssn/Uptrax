# UpTrax

## Description

UpTrax connects backcountry users so that they can find new touring partners and plan backcountry ski tours around the area of Nelson, BC, Canada.

Every winter, skiers and snowboarders from all over Canada and the world, travel to Nelson to explore the backcountry and ride some of North America's deepest and lightest powder. Although there are many backcountry users in the area, it can be difficult to find reliable and knowledgeable ski touring partners. This is especially true if you're new to the sport or are relatively inexperienced.

The backcountry is an unforgiving environment where one mistake can quite literally cost you your life. This makes finding knowledgeable, reliable and experienced partners a must if you're to mitigate some of traveling in avalanche terrain.

UpTrax allows more experienced users to mentor those who are relatively new to the sport, so that they can pass down the knowledge that will allow them to travel safely in the backcountry.
